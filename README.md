# Demo

The repo consists of various demos that showcase different functionalities of Copilot. Each demo is contained in its own directory under the `solution` folder. For example: solution\ConsoleApp.

# Directory Structure for Demos

- Every solution folder has the following structure:
  - The `src` folder contains the source code for the demo.
  - The `missing-features.md` file lists any features that are not implemented in the demo yet.
  - The `README.md` file provides an overview of the demo and instructions on how to run it.
