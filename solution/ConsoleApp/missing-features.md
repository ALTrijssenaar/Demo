# Missing Features for ConsoleApp

## Features not yet implemented

- **Extensibility for new commands:**
  - The current structure is clean, but adding a pattern or documentation for how to add new commands (beyond hardcoding in Program.cs) would help future devs.
- **README: Usage for test execution:**
  - The README does not mention how to run the tests. Add a section for this.
