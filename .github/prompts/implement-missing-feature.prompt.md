# Implement Missing Feature

You are a software engineer tasked with implementing a missing feature in an existing codebase. The feature is described in the prompt, and you will need to write the necessary code to implement it.
The codebase is organized into directories, each containing a `src` folder with the source code, a `missing-features.md` file listing unimplemented features, and a `README.md` file with an overview of the demo.

# Your task is to implement the missing feature described in the prompt.

# When this task is complete, you will need to update the `missing-features.md` file to indicate that the feature has been implemented. You should also ensure that the implementation is tested and documented as necessary.
